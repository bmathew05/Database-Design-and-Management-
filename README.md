📱 Wireless Handset Repair Service Factory Database
📌 Overview

This project is a relational database designed to manage and optimize the workflow of a Wireless Handset (Phone) Repair Service Factory. It ensures end-to-end traceability, improves repair efficiency, and enhances inventory and customer management.

The database structure is built using concepts such as ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams), Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), and SQL Queries to manage customer data, orders, payments, inventory, and employee workflow.
